\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|X|X|}
\hline
\thead{Service Type} & \thead{General Description} & \thead{Services Protected\\ (Focus)} & \thead{Limitations} & \thead{Benefits} \\
\hline
BGP-based DPS & Offers DDoS protection for network service providers, hosting, and cloud service providers. Specifically designed to protect against a wide range of DDoS attacks by filtering malicious traffic in the cloud. & Network infrastructure, hosting services, and cloud platforms. & Reliant on BGP routing, which can be complex; limited to /24 prefixes or larger. & Effective for large-scale protection; can handle massive volumes of traffic; reduces the risk of network overload. \\
\hline
On-premises Solutions & Provides DDoS protection through physical or virtual systems installed on the client's premises. These systems can be from any vendor and are designed to integrate with the client's existing network infrastructure. & Internal networks, specific applications, and servers within the client's control. & Can be resource-intensive; may not handle large-scale attacks well; requires ongoing maintenance. & Direct control over the protection measures; immediate response to attacks; customizable to specific network needs. \\
\hline
DNS-based DPS & Protects your digital estate with a product combining a web application firewall, bot mitigation, API security, and Layer 7 DDoS protection. Utilizes DNS redirection to divert attack traffic for cleansing and protection. & Web applications, APIs, and digital platforms. & Dependent on DNS functionality; might not cover non-web-based services. & Comprehensive protection for web assets; scalable; effective against sophisticated attacks. \\
\hline
Hybrid Solution & Integrates cloud-based, on-premises DDoS protection, and/or DNS-based DPS. Leverages the strengths of various solutions for a comprehensive approach. & Combination of network infrastructure, internal networks, web applications, and cloud services. & Complexity in integrating different solutions; can be costlier. & Versatile and comprehensive protection; scalable; balances immediate on-site response with large-scale cloud capabilities. \\
